                   <!--<p>During last three years my time was mostly occupied by working toward obtaining my business management bachelor, as well as working as a personal assistant of an event manager and lately as an event manager myself. The idea of becoming a Web- Dev came to my mind during the last year of studying, when I had my first contact with HTML and CSS at one of extra courses offered by University. Structuring information and shaping their design got me hooked immediately. Since then, I knew that someday I want to combine my managerial education with perfected knowledge of programming into position of Project Manager/Senior Developer. I believe that my work in Your company will be a stepping stone in that direction.</p>-->
